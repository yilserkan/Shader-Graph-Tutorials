# Shader-Graph-Tutorials

## About the project
I started this project to learn how Shader Graphs work within Unity. I created 2 different shader graphs. The first one is a shield shader. It has  This shader has kind of an breathing effect. The faces of the sphere(Shown in the first picture) are slowly moving apart and coming back together. The second shader is a ghost shader. This shader has an wobble effect. The ghost moves left and right on the same spot.
